## Introduction 
What's up hacker! Glad that you accepted the challenge! 
There are three stages in the first round. These stages are intended to guide you from not knowing dflow to a master of using dflow. 

## Stage 1: prepare your senses, learn to flow
1. we prepared a series of tutorials to learn dflow. You can find it here: [dflow-tutorials](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/tree/master/tutorials)
    There are several topics we intend to cover in this series:
    - Installation and setup 
    - Using dflow to write a simple workflow 
        - [dflow-helloworld.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-helloworld.ipynb)
        - [dflow-python.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-python.ipynb)
    - Using dflow with to submit job on cluter
        - [dflow-slurm.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-slurm.ipynb)
    - Advanced functionality of dflow
        - running jobs in parallel: [dflow-slices.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-slices.ipynb)
        - writing while loop in dflow: [dflow-recurse.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-recurse.ipynb)
        - reusing operated nodes: [dflow-reuse.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-reuse.ipynb)
        - complex condition: [dflow-conditional.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-conditional.ipynb)
2. these jupyter notebooks are intended to go through it on your own. But you can also watch the lecture here: [Link](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)

If you have questions, we suggest you raise an issue in [dflow issues](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/issues). 


## Stage 2: create your goal, explore the world 
In this stage, you are expected to propose your own project. The goal is to solve the repetitive task using dflow. **Start brainstorming!**
1. we invited three people to share their dflow workflows. [Link](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)
2. Writing proposal
For starters, you need to choose one of the six topics in this competition:
- AI-assisted molecular dynamics simulations
- AI-assisted electronic structure calculations
- Differentiable force field calculation engine
- Numerical solution algorithm library for partial differential equations
- Combustion reaction fluid computational platform
- Workflow suite

After that, it is the time to finish the proposal that is what you want to achieve within the topic you have chosen. You can find the template for proposal writing in the [supporting file](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022/blob/main/supporting/proposal_writing_template.md). You should submit your proposal by email to hackathon@dp.tech with the email title, ***yourName_WechatID_proposal***.

## Stage 3: hack your future, run the world
1. You will receive the feedback about your proposal on 07/25/2022 18:00 (GMT+8). You can check the information [here](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)

2. When you started to fulfill your potential to complete your project, we are here to provide you with several helpful tutorials and lectures for your reference. You can check the information [here](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)

3. The ***deadline*** to submit your project is on 08/04/2022 23:59 (GMT+8). You are supposed to submit it by email to hackathon@dp.tech.

And then, mentors will review your projects to determine whether you can enter the final round. Don't worry, if you finish your project carefully, prepare all the materials  and submit the project by deadline. You definitely can enter the project presentation. The project presentation is on **08/06/2022 09:00 (GMT+8)**.
