## Introduction 
What's up hacker! Glad that you accepted the challenge! 
There are three stages in the first round. These stages are intended to guide you from not knowing dflow to a master of using dflow. 

## Stage 1: prepare your senses, learn to flow
1. we prepared a series of tutorials to learn dflow. You can find it here: [dflow-tutorials](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/tree/master/tutorials)

    There are several topics we intend to cover in this series:
    - Installation and setup 
    - Using dflow to write a simple workflow 
        - [dflow-helloworld.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-helloworld.ipynb)
        - [dflow-python.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-python.ipynb)
    - Using dflow with to submit job on cluter
        - [dflow-slurm.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-slurm.ipynb)
    - Advanced functionality of dflow
        - running jobs in parallel: [dflow-slices.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-slices.ipynb)
        - writing while loop in dflow: [dflow-recurse.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-recurse.ipynb)
        - reusing operated nodes: [dflow-reuse.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-reuse.ipynb)
        - complex condition: [dflow-conditional.ipynb](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/blob/master/tutorials/dflow-conditional.ipynb)
2. these jupyter notebooks are intended to go through it on your own. But you can also watch the lecture here: [Link](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)

If you have questions, we suggest you raise an issue in [dflow issues](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/issues). 


## Stage 2: create your goal, explore the world 
In this stage, you are expected to propose your own project. The goal is to solve the repetitive task using dflow. **Start brainstorming!**
1. we invited three people to share their dflow workflows. [Link](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)
2. Writing proposal
For starters, you need to choose one of the six topics in this competition to improve the efficiency:
- AI-assisted molecular dynamics simulations
   - 选择此赛道的选手可围绕分子动力学模拟、解决同步学习训练数据生成算法自动化程度低的问题
- AI-assisted electronic structure calculations
   - 选择此赛道的选手可围绕第一性原理计算和机器学习泛函，解决使用第一性原理原理计算软件（量子化学、密度泛函理论）繁琐的文件准备，结果后处理等环节，或使用DeePKS-kit时繁琐重复的工作
- Differentiable force field calculation engine
   - 选择此赛道的选手可使用自动微分框架，解决立场开发（包括但不限于经典立场，可极化立场等）中参数优化困难、自动化程度低的问题
- Numerical solution algorithm library for partial differential equations
    - 选择此赛道的选手可使用偏微分方程数值解算法库，解决一些带参数数值的计算方法最优参数选择的问题
- Combustion reaction fluid computational platform
   - 选择此赛道的选手可使用DeepFlame燃烧反应流体力学求解框架，解决包括但不限于基于经典火焰面化学建表的燃烧计算中流程繁琐、参数优化困难、高维数据库生成速度慢、与CFD耦合自动化程度低等问题
- Workflow development kit 
    - please see this [issue](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/issues/34)
   
You can find the template for proposal writing in the [supporting file](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022/blob/main/supporting/proposal_writing_template.md). 

You should submit your proposal by email to **hackathon@dp.tech** with the email title, ***yourName_WechatID_proposal***.

## Stage 3: hack your future, run the world
1. You will receive the feedback about your proposal on 07/25/2022 18:00 (GMT+8). You can check the information [here](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)

2. When you started to fulfill your potential to complete your project, we are here to provide you with several helpful tutorials and lectures for your reference. You can check the information [here](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity/hackathon2022)

3. The ***deadline*** to submit your project is on 08/04/2022 23:59 (GMT+8). You are supposed to submit it by email to hackathon@dp.tech.

And then, mentors will review your projects to determine whether you can enter the final round. The project presentation is on **08/06/2022 09:00 (GMT+8)**.
